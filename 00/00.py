print("Hello, World!\n", sep = "", end = "")

# \n represents the newline character.
# print in Python automatically prints spaces between its arguments, when separated by commas. To avoid this, sep = "" is used. Similarly, print also automatically prints newline characters after each print command. To avoid this, end = "" is used.
