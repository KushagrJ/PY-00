a = 10
b = 13

c = a+b

print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is", c)





# /* Trivia
#
#  * a = a+22 will add 22 to the current value of a and assign the sum to a. So,
#    print(a) will now print 32, instead of 10.
#  * To execute multiple commands in the same line, semicolons should be used.
#    For eg., a = 10; b = 13 can also be used in this program.
