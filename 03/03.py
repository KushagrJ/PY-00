# /* Trivia
#
#  * Here, the input function assigns a string to a.
#  * Generally, strings require to be typed within quotes, whereas variables, numbers, etc. are typed without quotes.
#  * If the input is 5 for a = input(); print(a*5), then the output will be 55555, instead of 25.
#  * 3 is equal to 3.0, even though they aren't of the same data type.
