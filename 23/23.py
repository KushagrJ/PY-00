# /* Trivia
#
#  * A square array of numbers, usually distinct positive integers, is called a
#    magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column and both
#    main diagonals are the same. The order of the magic square is the number of
#    integers along one side (n) and the constant sum is called the magic
#    constant (M).
#
#  * An algorithm for the construction of odd-ordered magic squares with the
#    numbers being 1,2,3,4,5,...,n^2 is as follows:
#    (1) The postition of 1 is (int(n/2), n-1).
#    (2) If (i,j) is the position of a number, then the position of the next
#        number is given by (i-1, j+1)
